* `top()` - returns the top element of the stack
* `topAndPop()` - remove and return top element of the stack

### Employee Management System
This is a menu-driven program that allows the user to add, delete, search, print and print a given employee. There are
three types of employees - Full Time, Contractor and Manager. The program uses inheritance and polymorphism to implement
the different types of employees. The program uses an array list of objects to store the employees.
